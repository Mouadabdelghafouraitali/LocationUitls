# LocationUitls

Java class for android to get GPS location (latitude and longitude) which I wrote for my own projects which I decided to release as open source.

## How to use
Add the file in you android project, the following permissions must be added in the manifest.xml file in order to get permission to use the Location Manager.

´´´
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
´´´
